This Document is a step-by-step guide to activate turtlebot3_manipulation system created by turtlebot3 burger hardware(motors replaced with Dynamixel XM430-W350-T/R) and openManipulator-X

Firstly, flash Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS(64-bit) on raspberry pi sd card using Raspberry Pi Imager.

using ssh, get access to ubuntu and install the following on it.
example ssh command: ssh minion1@192.20.10.2

1. ros2 humble: Steps are given at this url: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html 
2. colcon: Steps are given at this url: https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/installation.html

run following commands on turtlebot3 ubuntu(refer: https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/manipulation/#manipulation)

    sudo apt install ros-humble-hardware-interface ros-humble-xacro ros-humble-ros2-control ros-humble-ros2-controllers ros-humble-gripper-controllers
    cd ~/turtlebot3_ws/src/
    git clone -b humble https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_manipulation.git
    cd ~/turtlebot3_ws && colcon build --symlink-install



Check if your dynamixel motors are correctly configured, use Dynamixel wizard 2.0 
first, connect OpenCR 1.0 board with your local system. Then, connect one motor at a time to OpenCR board for firmware recovery. Go to firmware recovery option in main menu and follow the given steps. To check which port of your local system is connected with OpenCR board, use the following command
    sudo dmesg | grep tty
Once, firmware recovery is completed for both the motors, scan the dynamixels and you can now configure them as per your needs.
For our use, change the ID of motors to 1(left motor) and 2(right motor) and set return delay time to 0 microseconds 



Next, install Arduino IDE 1.8.19 in your local system.
